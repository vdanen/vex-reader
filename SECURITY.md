# Reporting Security Issues

Security bugs in vex-reader are taken seriously. I appreciate your efforts
to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to
acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory
["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/vdanen/vex-reader/security/advisories/new)
tab.

I will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report.
After the initial reply to your report, I'll aim to keep you informed of
the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for
additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team
maintaining the module. I don't make a very good proxy for those other
projects.
