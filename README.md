![GitHub release (latest SemVer)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/vdanen/vex-reader?sort=semver)

Utility to read Red Hat VEX files that are located at https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/.

I'm (slowly) aiming to make this a bit more extensible so that it can be
used with other VEX files beyond just Red Hat, but I'm basing all of this
off of Red Hat VEX files to aim to make this a proper parsing library for
any VEX documents.

## Installation

Install [vex-reader](https://pypi.org/project/vex-reader/) from PyPI:

```shell
pip install vex-reader
```

## Usage

The best way to use vex-reader is to install the Python module.  It provides
the `vex-reader` binary and you can import the library for use in your own
applications.


```
vex-reader --vex tests/cve-2002-2443.json
CVE-2002-2443
-------------

Public on : 2002-06-15
Impact    : Moderate
CVSS Score: 5.0

Vulnerability summary
krb5: UDP ping-pong flaw in kpasswd


Vulnerability description
schpw.c in the kpasswd service in kadmind in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) before 1.11.3 does not properly validate UDP packets before
sending responses, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU and bandwidth consumption) via a forged packet that
triggers a communication loop, as demonstrated by krb_pingpong.nasl, a related issue to CVE-1999-0103.

By default, `vex-reader` will pull the CVSS score from NVD's API.  If this
is undesirable (for testing, etc) you can pass the `--no-nvd` argument to
prevent lookups. Currently, `vex-reader` requires the VEX file to parse to
be on-disk.

## Development

Contributions to vex-reader are welcome.  Currently it works predominantly with
Red Hat's VEX files and has limited success with othe VEX files (such as from
Cisco).  If `vex-reader` fails to parse the VEX file you're feeding it, you can
either submit a patch or open an issue and link to the VEX file you're trying
to parse.

### Development setup:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/vdanen/vex-reader.git
cd vex-reader
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e .
```

When working from the git repository for development, use:

```
$ python -m vex.vex_reader --vex tests/cve-2002-2443.json
```
