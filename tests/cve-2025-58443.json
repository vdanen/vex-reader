It is possible for an attacker to perform an unauthenticated DB dump where they could pull a full SQL DB without credentials. A fix is expected to be released 9/15/2025. To address this vulnerability immediately, upgrade to the latest version of either the dev-branch or working-1.6 branch. This will patch the issue for users concerned about immediate exposure.
